# Scrcpy-mask

A Scrcpy (control) client in Rust & Tarui aimed at providing mouse and key mapping.

Due to the delay and blurred image quality of the mirror screen. This project found another way, directly abandoned the mirror screen, and instead used a transparent mask to display the screen content behind the window, which fundamentally put an end to the delay in casting the screen.
